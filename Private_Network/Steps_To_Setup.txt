To setup private network foe ethereum, following installation is mandatory:

Geth(Go-Ethereum): CLI, used to mine, generate ether, transfer funds, create accounts on your peivate network.

To download it: https://ethereum.github.io./go-ethereum/downloads 

For geth use PowerShell, because some sources says that all commands are not well executable with Command Prompt.

Ganache : It provides GUI for blockchain & node representation, just like and emulator. (optional) 
Git: Version and control system(optional)

Step-1: After installing and setting up geth, create directory or we can say private directory where all the files and blocks will be stored. 

Step-2: Using following command we can create directory,
		mkdir directory_name
		inside that directory,
		cd directory_name use 'puppeth'

Step-3: Specify network name, later on we can set this via --network = new_network_name 

Step-4: It'll display menu with 4 choices, select 2. Configure New Genesis.
		Here Genesis is a genesis block, a very first block of our blockchain.
		
Step-5: Select consensus engine, Ethash (Proof-of-work) and leave prefunded account with just enter.

Step-6: Specify ChainId/NetworkId.
		Reserved/used id for public network are:
		1. Main Network 
		2. Morden Testnet (Obselete)
		3. Ropsten Testnet
		4. Rinkeby Testnet
		42. Kovan Testnet

Step-7: Export created genesis in .json file. Select 2. Manage existing genesis and again 2. Export genesis configurations.

Step-8: ctrl+c to quit puppeth, using 
		
		geth --datadir . init ./YourGenesisJsonFileName.json
		
		It'll shows detail about time stamp, nodes, caches, hash, etc.
	
Step-9: By using 'ls' , list of files will display.
		
		- geth (stores all data for the chain)
		- keystore (stores all our accounts)

Step-10: Create account, which will act as buyer/seller/mining rewards	

		geth --datadir . account new
		
		It'll ask for password, each account have its own private key.
		Passphrase:
		Repassphrase:
		
Step-11: Create startnode.cmd file and password.sec file using editor. Startnode have different commands to mine nodes from given account index, and password.sec file will used to unlock requested acount using password.
		
		notepad ./startnode.cmd
		
		geth --networkid your_networkid --mine --minerthreads noOfThreads --datadir ".(currentdir)" --nodiscover --rpc --rpcport "8545" --port "30303" --rpccorsdomain "*" --nat "any" --rpcapi eth,web3,personal,net --unlock 0 --password .\password.sec 
			
		now store your pasword in password.sec file.

Step-12: Run/open source node file with	./startnode.cmd, it'll automatically  execute mining process.
		
		epoch: is a period of a 30k blocks.
		
Step-13: Open another PowerShell, use given command:
		
		geth attach ipc:\\.\pipe\geth.ipc
	
Step-14: Commands to execute: 
	
		>eth.accounts: will display all accounts of ethereum.
		
		>eth.coinbase: base address, i.e 0
		
		>eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase): gives balance of parameterized account
		
		>eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[1])
		0
		
Step-15 To start mining, 
		>miner.start()
		
		To stop mining,
		>miner.stop()
		
		to get hashrate of mining,
		>miner.getHashrate
